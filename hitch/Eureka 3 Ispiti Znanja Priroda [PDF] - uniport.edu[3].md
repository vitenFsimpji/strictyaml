# Eureka 3: A Comprehensive Resource for Learning Priroda
 
Priroda is a subject that covers natural and social sciences in Croatian primary schools. It aims to develop students' curiosity, observation, and critical thinking skills about the world around them. Priroda covers topics such as living beings, matter, energy, weather, geography, history, culture, and society.
 
However, learning Priroda can be challenging for some students, especially when it comes to preparing for exams. That's why Eureka 3 is a valuable resource for both teachers and students who want to master Priroda in the third grade.

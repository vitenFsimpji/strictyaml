# How to Use WolframAlpha for Free and Solve Your Math Problems
  
WolframAlpha is a powerful online tool that can answer almost any question you have. It can solve complex math problems, provide instant knowledge on various topics, and even generate graphs and charts for your data. But if you want to access some of its advanced features, such as step-by-step solutions, you need to pay for a WolframAlpha Pro subscription, which costs $4.99 per month.
  
However, there is a way to use WolframAlpha for free and get all the benefits of its Pro features. In this article, we will show you how to do that using Wolfram's own services. You will be able to see the detailed steps for solving any math problem, as well as download the results as PDF files. You will also be able to upload your own data and images for analysis, and get customized and interactive visuals for presentations.

## Step 1: Go to Wolfram Cloud
  
The first thing you need to do is go to [Wolfram Cloud](https://www.wolframcloud.com/), which is a platform that allows you to create and run Wolfram Language code online. Wolfram Language is the same language that powers WolframAlpha, so you can use it to perform the same computations and queries.
  
Wolfram Cloud offers a free plan that gives you 1 GB of cloud storage, 1000 cloud credits per month, and access to all Wolfram Language functions. You can sign up with your email address or your social media account.
  
## Step 2: Create a New Notebook
  
Once you are logged in to Wolfram Cloud, you will see a dashboard with various options. To create a new notebook, click on the "New" button on the top left corner, and select "Notebook" from the drop-down menu.
  
A notebook is a document that allows you to write and execute Wolfram Language code interactively. You can also add text, images, graphics, and other elements to your notebook. A notebook has two types of cells: input cells and output cells. Input cells are where you type your code, and output cells are where you see the results of your code.
  
## Step 3: Enter Your Query
  
To enter your query, you need to use the same syntax as WolframAlpha. For example, if you want to solve a quadratic equation, you can type something like this:

  `Solve[x^2 + 5x - 6 == 0]`  
To execute your code, press Shift+Enter or click on the "Evaluate Cell" button on the top right corner of the input cell. You will see the output cell below with the answer:
  `x -> -6, x -> 1`  
If you want to see the step-by-step solution for your query, you need to add another argument to your code: `Method -> "ReduceStepByStep"`. This will tell Wolfram Language to show you how it arrived at the answer. For example:
  `Solve[x^2 + 5x - 6 == 0, Method -> "ReduceStepByStep"]`  
This will produce an output cell with a detailed explanation of each step:
  `
Solve[x^2 + 5 x - 6 == 0]

To solve for x in x^2 + 5 x - 6 == 0:

Move all terms not containing x to the right-hand side.

x^2 + 5 x == 6

Factor out any common factors.

x (x + 5) == 6

Factor x^2 + 5 x.

(x + 6) (x - 1) == 6

Set each factor equal to zero.

x + 6 == 0 or x - 1 == 0

Solve for x in each equation.

x == -6 or x == 1
`  
You can also use other functions and queries that WolframAlpha supports, such as `Integrate`, `Differentiate`, `Plot`, `Simplify`, `Expand`, `Factor`

If you are looking for a high-quality, expert-level audio dynamics processor for Winamp that can provide more loudness, punch and consistency in your broadcast audio, you might want to check out AudioProc. AudioProc is a plugin that utilizes the same multiband compression/expansion/limiting technology that expensive professional broadcast hardware is based upon[^1^]. In this article, we will explain what AudioProc can do for your broadcast audio quality and how to use it effectively.

## What is AudioProc?
 
AudioProc is a Winamp plugin that can enhance your broadcast audio quality by applying various processing techniques to your audio signal. AudioProc can:
 
- Reduce the dynamic range of your audio, making it easier to listen in noisy environments and preventing excessive modulation[^2^]
- Make segues between different audio sources more consistent by automatically adjusting the spectral balance[^2^]
- Develop a characteristic audio signature and personality for your station by using the 10-band equalizer and other controls[^1^]
- Liven up dull or quiet material and soften or tame excessively edgy or loud material[^1^]
- Produce a warm and bright, non-fatiguing, properly balanced and artifact-free sound that resembles the competitive 'on the air' sound signature of major market FM radio stations[^1^]

## How to Use AudioProc?
 
AudioProc is easy to install and use with Winamp. You can download the plugin from [here](https://winampheritage.com/plugin/audioproc-broadcast-audio-processor/221887) and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you can access AudioProc from the Winamp Preferences menu under DSP/Effect. You will see a window with over 300 controls that you can adjust to fine-tune your audio processing settings. You can also use presets or save your own settings for different types of audio sources.
 
AudioProc offers four main processing sections: Input Gain, Multiband Compressor/Limiter/Expander, Equalizer and Output Limiter. Each section has its own controls and meters that show you the input and output levels, gain reduction and frequency spectrum of your audio signal. You can enable or disable each section by clicking on the corresponding button on the top of the window. Here is a brief overview of what each section does:

- Input Gain: This section allows you to adjust the input level of your audio signal before it goes into the multiband compressor/limiter/expander. You can use the Input Gain slider to increase or decrease the input level, or use the Auto Gain button to let AudioProc automatically adjust the input level based on the average level of your audio signal.
- Multiband Compressor/Limiter/Expander: This section is the core of AudioProc's processing technology. It splits your audio signal into four frequency bands (low, low-mid, high-mid and high) and applies compression, limiting and expansion to each band separately. Compression reduces the dynamic range of your audio signal by lowering the volume of loud sounds and raising the volume of soft sounds. Limiting prevents your audio signal from exceeding a certain level by cutting off any peaks that go above that level. Expansion increases the dynamic range of your audio signal by raising the volume of soft sounds and lowering the volume of loud sounds. You can adjust various parameters for each band, such as threshold, ratio, attack, release, makeup gain and crossover frequency. You can also use the Solo buttons to listen to each band individually or use the Bypass buttons to disable processing for each band.
- Equalizer: This section allows you to adjust the frequency balance of your audio signal by boosting or cutting certain frequency ranges. You can use the 10-band graphic equalizer to adjust each frequency band by dragging the sliders up or down, or use the Parametric EQ button to switch to a parametric equalizer mode where you can adjust more parameters such as bandwidth and slope for each band. You can also use the Preset buttons to choose from some common equalizer settings or use the Bypass button to disable equalization.
- Output Limiter: This section allows you to control the output level of your audio signal after it goes through all the processing

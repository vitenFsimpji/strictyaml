Ride is a composition by American composer Samuel R. Hazo, written for wind ensemble in 2002. It was commissioned by the 2003 National Band Association Convention for the Washington Winds, conducted by Edward Petersen. The piece is inspired by Hazo's daughter, who asked him to write a piece that sounded like a fast car ride. The piece is fast-paced, energetic and rhythmic, featuring frequent changes of meter and syncopation. The piece also uses various percussion instruments, such as ride cymbals, snare drums, Chinese cymbals, tam-tams and tubular bells, to create a driving and exciting sound.
 
The piece has become one of Hazo's most popular and performed works, and has been recorded by several ensembles, such as the United States Marine Band and the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra. The piece has also been arranged for various instrumentations, such as brass ensemble, mixed trio and solo instruments. The piece is challenging and demanding for both performers and listeners, requiring technical skill, endurance and concentration. The piece is also fun and exhilarating, capturing the thrill and joy of a fast car ride.
